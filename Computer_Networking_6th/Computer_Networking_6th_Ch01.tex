\section{Computer Networks and the Internet}
\begin{itemize}

\item The Internet is a computer network that interconnects hundreds of millions of computing devices throughout the world.

\item Indeed, the term \textit{computer network} is beginning to sound a bit dated, given the many nontraditional devices that are being hooked up to the Internet. In Internet jargon, all of these devices are called \textbf{hosts} or \textbf{end systems}.

\item End systems are connected together by a network of \textbf{communication links} and \textbf{packet switches}.

\item Packet switches come in many shapes and flavors, but the two most prominent types in today's Internet are \textbf{routers} and \textbf{link-layer switches}.
