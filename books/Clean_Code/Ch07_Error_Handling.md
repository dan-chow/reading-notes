## Chapter 07: Error Handling

Error handling is important, but if it
obscures logic, it’s wrong.


In a way, try blocks are like transactions. Your catch has to leave your program in a
consistent state, no matter what happens in the try. For this reason it is good practice to
start with a try-catch-finally statement when you are writing code that could throw
exceptions. This helps you define what the user of that code should expect, no matter what
goes wrong with the code that is executed in the try.



The price of checked exceptions is an Open/Closed Principle1 violation.
If you throw a checked exception from a method in your code and the catch is three levels
above, you must declare that exception in the signature of each method between you and
the catch. This means that a change at a low level of the software can force signature
changes on many higher levels. The changed modules must be rebuilt and redeployed,
even though nothing they care about changed.


Each exception that you throw should provide enough context to determine the source and
location of an error. In Java, you can get a stack trace from any exception; however, a stack
trace can’t tell you the intent of the operation that failed.


In fact, wrapping
third-party APIs is a best practice. When you wrap a third-party API, you minimize your
dependencies upon it: You can choose to move to a different library in the future without
much penalty. Wrapping also makes it easier to mock out third-party calls when you are
testing your own code.

One final advantage of wrapping is that you aren’t tied to a particular vendor’s API
design choices. You can define an API that you feel comfortable with.



Let’s take a look at an example. Here is some awkward code that sums expenses in a
billing application:
try {
MealExpenses expenses = expenseReportDAO.getMeals(employee.getID());
m_total += expenses.getTotal();
} catch(MealExpensesNotFound e) {
m_total += getMealPerDiem();
}
In this business, if meals are expensed, they become part of the total. If they aren’t, the
employee gets a meal per diem amount for that day. The exception clutters the logic.
Wouldn’t it be better if we didn’t have to deal with the special case? If we didn’t, our code
would look much simpler. It would look like this:
MealExpenses expenses = expenseReportDAO.getMeals(employee.getID());
m_total += expenses.getTotal();

Can we make the code that simple? It turns out that we can. We can change the
ExpenseReportDAO so that it always returns a MealExpense object. If there are no meal
expenses, it returns a MealExpense object that returns the per diem as its total:
public class PerDiemMealExpenses implements MealExpenses {
public int getTotal() {
// return the per diem default
}
}
This is called the SPECIAL CASE PATTERN [Fowler]. You create a class or configure an
object so that it handles a special case for you. When you do, the client code doesn’t have
to deal with exceptional behavior. That behavior is encapsulated in the special case object.




I think that any discussion about error handling should include mention of the things we
do that invite errors. The first on the list is returning null. I can’t begin to count the number
of applications I’ve seen in which nearly every other line was a check for null.


If you are tempted to return null from
a method, consider throwing an exception or returning a SPECIAL CASE object instead. If
you are calling a null-returning method from a third-party API, consider wrapping that
method with a method that either throws an exception or returns a special case object.


In most programming languages there is no good way to deal with a null that is
passed by a caller accidentally. Because this is the case, the rational approach is to forbid
passing null by default. When you do, you can code with the knowledge that a null in an
argument list is an indication of a problem, and end up with far fewer careless mistakes.
