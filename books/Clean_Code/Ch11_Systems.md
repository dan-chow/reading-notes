## Chapter 11: Systems

Software systems should separate the startup process, when the application objects are
constructed and the dependencies are “wired” together, from the runtime logic that takes
over after startup.



The code for the startup
process is ad hoc and it is mixed in with the runtime logic. Here is a typical example:

```java
public Service getService() {
if (service == null)
service = new MyServiceImpl(...); // Good enough default for most cases?
return service;
}
```

This is the LAZY INITIALIZATION/EVALUATION idiom, and it has several merits. We
don’t incur the overhead of construction unless we actually use the object, and our startup
times can be faster as a result. We also ensure that null is never returned.

However, we now have a hard-coded dependency on MyServiceImpl and everything its
constructor requires (which I have elided). We can’t compile without resolving these
dependencies, even if we never actually use an object of this type at runtime!



If we are diligent about building well-formed and robust systems, we should never let
little, convenient idioms lead to modularity breakdown. The startup process of object construction
and wiring is no exception. We should modularize this process separately from
the normal runtime logic and we should make sure that we have a global, consistent strategy
for resolving our major dependencies.



A powerful mechanism for separating construction from use is Dependency Injection (DI),
the application of Inversion of Control (IoC) to dependency management.3 Inversion of
Control moves secondary responsibilities from an object to other objects that are dedicated
to the purpose, thereby supporting the Single Responsibility Principle. In the context of
dependency management, an object should not take responsibility for instantiating dependencies
itself. Instead, it should pass this responsibility to another “authoritative” mechanism,
thereby inverting the control.



JNDI lookups are a “partial” implementation of DI, where an object asks a directory
server to provide a “service” matching a particular name.

MyService myService = (MyService)(jndiContext.lookup(“NameOfMyService”));

The invoking object doesn’t control what kind of object is actually returned (as long it
implements the appropriate interface, of course), but the invoking object still actively
resolves the dependency.

True Dependency Injection goes one step further. The class takes no direct steps to
resolve its dependencies; it is completely passive. Instead, it provides setter methods or
constructor arguments (or both) that are used to inject the dependencies. During the construction
process, the DI container instantiates the required objects (usually on demand)
and uses the constructor arguments or setter methods provided to wire together the dependencies.
Which dependent objects are actually used is specified through a configuration
file or programmatically in a special-purpose construction module.



It is a myth that we can get systems “right the first time.” Instead, we should implement
only today’s stories, then refactor and expand the system to implement new stories
tomorrow. This is the essence of iterative and incremental agility. Test-driven development,
refactoring, and the clean code they produce make this work at the code level.


Software systems are unique compared to physical systems. Their architectures can grow
incrementally, if we maintain the proper separation of concerns.



In fact, the way the EJB architecture handled persistence, security, and transactions,
“anticipated” aspect-oriented programming (AOP),7 which is a general-purpose approach
to restoring modularity for cross-cutting concerns.

In AOP, modular constructs called aspects specify which points in the system should
have their behavior modified in some consistent way to support a particular concern. This
specification is done using a succinct declarative or programmatic mechanism.



Java proxies are suitable for simple situations, such as wrapping method calls in individual
objects or classes. However, the dynamic proxies provided in the JDK only work with
interfaces. To proxy classes, you have to use a byte-code manipulation library, such as
CGLIB, ASM, or Javassist.



Fortunately, most of the proxy boilerplate can be handled automatically by tools. Proxies
are used internally in several Java frameworks, for example, Spring AOP and JBoss AOP,
to implement aspects in pure Java.12 In Spring, you write your business logic as Plain-Old
Java Objects. POJOs are purely focused on their domain. They have no dependencies on
enterprise frameworks (or any other domains). Hence, they are conceptually simpler and
easier to test drive. The relative simplicity makes it easier to ensure that you are implementing
the corresponding user stories correctly and to maintain and evolve the code for
future stories.

You incorporate the required application infrastructure, including cross-cutting concerns
like persistence, transactions, security, caching, failover, and so on, using declarative
configuration files or APIs. In many cases, you are actually specifying Spring or
JBoss library aspects, where the framework handles the mechanics of using Java proxies
or byte-code libraries transparently to the user. These declarations drive the dependency
injection (DI) container, which instantiates the major objects and wires them together on
demand.

Finally, the most full-featured tool for separating concerns through aspects is the AspectJ
language, an extension of Java that provides “first-class” support for aspects as modularity
constructs. The pure Java approaches provided by Spring AOP and JBoss AOP are sufficient
for 80–90 percent of the cases where aspects are most useful. However, AspectJ
provides a very rich and powerful tool set for separating concerns. The drawback of
AspectJ is the need to adopt several new tools and to learn new language constructs and
usage idioms.




The power of separating concerns through aspect-like approaches can’t be overstated. If
you can write your application’s domain logic using POJOs, decoupled from any architecture
concerns at the code level, then it is possible to truly test drive your architecture. You
can evolve it from simple to sophisticated, as needed, by adopting new technologies on
demand. It is not necessary to do a Big Design Up Front (BDUF). In fact, BDUF is even
harmful because it inhibits adapting to change, due to the psychological resistance to discarding
prior effort and because of the way architecture choices influence subsequent
thinking about the design.



An optimal system architecture consists of modularized domains of concern, each of which
is implemented with Plain Old Java (or other) Objects. The different domains are integrated
together with minimally invasive Aspects or Aspect-like tools. This architecture can
be test-driven, just like the code.


We all know it is best to give responsibilities to the most qualified persons. We often
forget that it is also best to postpone decisions until the last possible moment. This isn’t
lazy or irresponsible; it lets us make informed choices with the best possible information.
A premature decision is a decision made with suboptimal knowledge. We will have that
much less customer feedback, mental reflection on the project, and experience with our
implementation choices if we decide too soon.

The agility provided by a POJO system with modularized concerns allows us to make optimal,
just-in-time decisions, based on the most recent knowledge. The complexity of these
decisions is also reduced.




Standards make it easier to reuse ideas and components, recruit people with relevant experience,
encapsulate good ideas, and wire components together. However, the process of
creating standards can sometimes take too long for industry to wait, and some standards
lose touch with the real needs of the adopters they are intended to serve.



Domain-Specific Languages allow all levels of abstraction and all domains in the application
to be expressed as POJOs, from high-level policy to low-level details.
