## Chapter 02: Meaningful Names

The name of a variable, function, or class, should answer all the big questions. It
should tell you why it exists, what it does, and how it is used. If a name requires a comment,
then the name does not reveal its intent.


Noise words are redundant. The word variable should never appear in a variable
name. The word table should never appear in a table name. How is NameString better than
Name? Would a Name ever be a floating point number? If so, it breaks an earlier rule about
disinformation.


My personal preference is that single-letter names can ONLY be used as local variables
inside short methods. The length of a name should correspond to the size of its scope
[N5]. If a variable or constant might be seen or used in multiple places in a body of code,
it is imperative to give it a search-friendly name.


One difference between a smart programmer and a professional programmer is that
the professional understands that clarity is king. Professionals use their powers for good
and write code that others can understand.


When constructors are overloaded, use static factory methods with names that
describe the arguments. For example,
Complex fulcrumPoint = Complex.FromRealNumber(23.0);
is generally better than
Complex fulcrumPoint = new Complex(23.0);



There are a few names which are meaningful in and of themselvesâ€”most are not. Instead,
you need to place names in context for your reader by enclosing them in well-named
classes, functions, or namespaces. When all else fails, then prefixing the name may be necessary
as a last resort.
