## Chapter 01: Professionalism

- Professionalism is a loaded term. Certainly it is a badge of honor and pride, but it is also a marker of responsibility and accountability. The two go hand in hand, of course. You can’t take pride and honor in something that you can’t be held accountable for.

- No, I’m telling you that you must be responsible for your imperfections. The fact that bugs will certainly occur in your code does not mean you aren’t responsible for them. The fact that the task to write perfect software is virtually impossible does not mean you aren’t responsible for the imperfection.

- Am I suggesting 100% test coverage? No, I’m not suggesting it. I’m demanding it. Every single line of code that you write should be tested. Period.

- But isn’t some code hard to test? Yes, but only because that code has been designed to be hard to test. The solution to that is to design your code to be easy to test. And the best way to do that is to write your tests first, before you write the code that passes them.

- Much has been written about the principles and patterns of software design that support structures that are flexible and maintainable. Professional software developers commit these things to memory and strive to conform their software to them. But there’s a trick to this that far too few software developers follow: If you want your software to be flexible, you have to flex it!

	The only way to prove that your software is easy to change is to make easy changes to it. And when you find that the changes aren’t as easy as you thought, you refine the design so that the next change is easier.

	When do you make these easy changes? All the time! Every time you look at a module you make small, lightweight changes to it to improve its structure. Every time you read through the code you adjust the structure.

	This philosophy is sometimes called merciless refactoring. I call it “the Boy Scout rule”: Always check in a module cleaner than when you checked it out. Always make some random act of kindness to the code whenever you see it.

- Here is a minimal list of the things that every software professional should be conversant with:
	- Design patterns. You ought to be able to describe all 24 patterns in the GOF book and have a working knowledge of many of the patterns in the POSA books.
	- Design principles. You should know the SOLID principles and have a good understanding of the component principles.
	- Methods. You should understand XP, Scrum, Lean, Kanban, Waterfall, Structured Analysis, and Structured Design.
	- Disciplines. You should practice TDD, Object-Oriented design, Structured Programming, Continuous Integration, and Pair Programming.
	- Artifacts: You should know how to use: UML, DFDs, Structure Charts, Petri Nets, State Transition Diagrams and Tables, flow charts, and decision tables.
