## Chapter 13: Teams and Projects

- It takes time for a team like this to work out their differences, come to terms with each other, and really gel. It might take six months. It might even take a year. But once it happens, it’s magic. A gelled team will plan together, solve problems together, face issues together, and get things done.

	Once this happens, it is ludicrous to break it apart just because a project comes to an end. It’s best to keep that team together and just keep feeding it projects.
