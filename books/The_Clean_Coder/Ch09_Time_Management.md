## Chapter 09: Time Management

- The person inviting you to a meeting is not responsible for managing your time. Only you can do that. So when you receive a meeting invitation, don’t accept unless it is a meeting for which your participation is immediately and significantly necessary to the job you are doing now.

- Kent Beck once told me something profound: “Any argument that can’t be settled in five minutes can’t be settled by arguing.” The reason it goes on so long is that there is no clear evidence supporting either side. The argument is probably religious, as opposed to factual.

- Prudence and experience will help you avoid certain blind alleys, but you’ll never avoid them all. So the real skill you need is to quickly realize when you are in one, and have the courage to back out. This is sometimes called The Rule of Holes: When you are in one, stop digging.
