## Chapter 03: The Hadoop Distributed Filesystem

### The Design of HDFS

### HDFS Concepts

- HDFS blocks are large compared to disk blocks, and the reason is to minimize the cost of seeks. By making a block large enough, the time to transfer the data from the disk can be significantly longer than the time to seek to the start of the block. Thus the time to transfer a large file made of multiple blocks operates at the disk transfer rate.

- Like in a filesystem for a single disk, files in HDFS are broken into block-sized chunks, which are stored as independent units. Unlike a filesystem for a single disk, a file in HDFS that is smaller than a single block does not occupy a full block’s worth of underlying storage. Having a block abstraction for a distributed filesystem brings several benefits. The first benefit is the most obvious: a file can be larger than any single disk in the network. Second, making the unit of abstraction a block rather than a file simplifies the storage subsystem. Furthermore, blocks fit well with replication for providing fault tolerance and availability.

- An HDFS cluster has two types of nodes operating in a master-worker pattern: a namenode (the master) and a number of datanodes (workers). The namenode manages the filesystem namespace. It maintains the filesystem tree and the metadata for all the files and directories in the tree. This information is stored persistently on the local disk in the form of two files: the namespace image and the edit log. The namenode also knows the datanodes on which all the blocks for a given file are located; however, it does not store block locations persistently, because this information is reconstructed from datanodes when the system starts.

- Datanodes are the workhorses of the filesystem. They store and retrieve blocks when they are told to (by clients or the namenode), and they report back to the namenode periodically with lists of blocks that they are storing.

- It is important to make the namenode resilient to failure, and Hadoop provides two mechanisms for this. The first way is to back up the files that make up the persistent state of the filesystem metadata. Hadoop can be configured so that the namenode writes its persistent state to multiple filesystems. It is also possible to run a secondary namenode, which despite its name does not act as a namenode. Its main role is to periodically merge the namespace image with the edit log to prevent the edit log from becoming too large.

- The transition from the active namenode to the standby is managed by a new entity in the system called the failover controller. Failover controllers are pluggable, but the first implementation uses ZooKeeper to ensure that only one namenode is active. Each namenode runs a lightweight failover controller process whose job it is to monitor its namenode for failures (using a simple heartbeating mechanism) and trigger a failover should a namenode fail.

- The HA implementation goes to great lengths to ensure that the previously active namenode is prevented from doing any damage and causing corruption—a method known as fencing. The system employs a range of fencing mechanisms, including killing the namenode’s process, revoking its access to the shared storage directory (typically by using a vendor-specific NFS command), and disabling its network port via a remote management command. As a last resort, the previously active namenode can be fenced with a technique rather graphically known as STONITH, or “shoot the other node in the head,” which uses a specialized power distribution unit to forcibly power down the host machine.

### The Command-Line Interface

### Hadoop Filesystems

- There are two ways of accessing HDFS over HTTP: directly, where the HDFS daemons serve HTTP requests to clients; and via a proxy (or proxies), which accesses HDFS on the client’s behalf using the usual DistributedFileSystem API.

- Accessing HDFS over HTTP directly and via a bank of HDFS proxies

### The Java Interface

- One of the simplest ways to read a file from a Hadoop filesystem is by using a java.net.URL object to open a stream to read the data from.
  ```java
  InputStream in = new URL("hdfs://host/path").openStream();
  ```

- As the previous section explained, sometimes it is impossible to set a URLStreamHand lerFactory for your application. In this case, you will need to use the FileSystem API to open an input stream for a file. A file in a Hadoop filesystem is represented by a Hadoop Path object (and not a java.io.File object, since its semantics are too closely tied to the local filesystem). You can think of a Path as a Hadoop filesystem URI. FileSystem is a general filesystem API, so the first step is to retrieve an instance for the
filesystem we want to use—HDFS in this case.
With a FileSystem instance in hand, we invoke an open() method to get the input stream
for a file.
  ```java
  FileSystem fs = FileSystem.get(URI.create(uri), conf);
  InputStream in = fs.open(new Path(uri));
  ```

- The open() method on FileSystem actually returns a FSDataInputStream rather than a standard java.io class. This class is a specialization of java.io.DataInputStream with support for random access, so you can read from any part of the stream:
  ```java
  public class FSDataInputStream extends DataInputStream implements Seekable, PositionedReadable {
    // implementation elided
  }
  ```
	The Seekable interface permits seeking to a position in the file and a query method for the current offset from the start of the file (getPos()):
  ```java
  public interface Seekable {
    void seek(long pos) throws IOException;
    long getPos() throws IOException;
  }
  ```
	FSDataInputStream also implements the PositionedReadable interface for reading parts of a file at a given offset:
  ```java
  public interface PositionedReadable {
    public int read(long position, byte[] buffer, int offset, int length) throws IOException;
    public void readFully(long position, byte[] buffer, int offset, int length) throws IOException;
    public void readFully(long position, byte[] buffer) throws IOException;
  }
  ```

- The FileSystem class has a number of methods for creating a file. The simplest is the method that takes a Path object for the file to be created and returns an output stream to write to. There’s also an overloaded method for passing a callback interface, Progressable, so your application can be notified of the progress of the data being written to the datanodes:
  ```java
  public interface Progressable {
    public void progress();
  }
  ```
	As an alternative to creating a new file, you can append to an existing file using the append() method.


- The create() method on FileSystem returns an FSDataOutputStream, which, like FSDataInputStream, has a method for querying the current position in the file:
  ```java
  public class FSDataOutputStream extends DataOutputStream implements Syncable {
    public long getPos() throws IOException {
      // implementation elided
    }
    // implementation elided
  }
  ```
	However, unlike FSDataInputStream, FSDataOutputStream does not permit seeking. This is because HDFS allows only sequential writes to an open file or appends to an already written file. In other words, there is no support for writing to anywhere other than the end of the file, so there is no value in being able to seek while writing.

- The method getFileStatus() on FileSystem provides a way of getting a FileStatus object for a single file or directory. Finding information on a single file or directory is useful, but you also often need to be able to list the contents of a directory. That’s what FileSystem’s listStatus() methods are for. Rather than having to enumerate each file and directory to specify the input, it is convenient to use wildcard characters to match multiple files with a single expression, an operation that is known as globbing. The globStatus() method returns an array of FileStatus objects whose paths match the supplied pattern, sorted by path. An optional PathFilter can be specified to restrict the matches further. The listStatus() and globStatus() methods of FileSystem take an optional PathFilter, which allows programmatic control over matching:
  ```java
  public interface PathFilter {
    boolean accept(Path path);
  }
  ```

### Data Flow

- A client reading data from HDFS  
![alt text](img/fig_3_2_A_client_reading_data_from_HDFS.PNG)  

- What does it mean for two nodes in a local network to be “close” to each other? In the context of high-volume data processing, the limiting factor is the rate at which we can transfer data between nodes—bandwidth is a scarce commodity. The idea is to use the bandwidth between two nodes as a measure of distance. Rather than measuring bandwidth between nodes, which can be difficult to do in practice (it requires a quiet cluster, and the number of pairs of nodes in a cluster grows as the square of the number of nodes), Hadoop takes a simple approach in which the network is represented as a tree and the distance between two nodes is the sum of their distances to their closest common ancestor. Levels in the tree are not predefined, but it is common to have levels that correspond to the data center, the rack, and the node that a process is running on. The idea is that the bandwidth available for each of the following scenarios becomes progressively less:
	- Processes on the same node
	- Different nodes on the same rack
	- Nodes on different racks in the same data center
	- Nodes in different data centers

- A client writing data to HDFS  
![alt text](img/fig_3_4_A client writing data to HDFS.PNG)  

- As the client writes data, DFSOutputStream splits it into packets, which it writes to an internal queue, called the data queue. The data queue is consumed by the Data Streamer, which is responsible for asking the namenode to allocate new blocks by picking a list of suitable datanodes to store the replicas. The list of datanodes forms a pipeline, and here we’ll assume the replication level is three, so there are three nodes in the pipeline. The DataStreamer streams the packets to the first datanode in the pipeline, which stores the packet and forwards it to the second datanode in the pipeline.

- DFSOutputStream also maintains an internal queue of packets that are waiting to be acknowledged by datanodes, called the ack queue. A packet is removed from the ack queue only when it has been acknowledged by all the datanodes in the pipeline.

- If a datanode fails while data is being written to it, then the following actions are taken, which are transparent to the client writing the data. First, the pipeline is closed, and any packets in the ack queue are added to the front of the data queue so that datanodes that are downstream from the failed node will not miss any packets. The current block on the good datanodes is given a new identity, which is communicated to the namenode, so that the partial block on the failed datanode will be deleted if the failed datanode recovers later on. The failed datanode is removed from the pipeline, and the remainder of the block’s data is written to the two good datanodes in the pipeline. The namenode notices that the block is under-replicated, and it arranges for a further replica to be created on another node. Subsequent blocks are then treated as normal.

- How does the namenode choose which datanodes to store replicas on? There’s a tradeoff between reliability and write bandwidth and read bandwidth here. Hadoop’s default strategy is to place the first replica on the same node as the client (for clients running outside the cluster, a node is chosen at random, although the system tries not to pick nodes that are too full or too busy). The second replica is placed on a different rack from the first (off-rack), chosen at random. The third replica is placed on the same rack as the second, but on a different node chosen at random. Further replicas are placed on random nodes on the cluster, although the system tries to avoid placing too many replicas on the same rack.

- After creating a file, it is visible in the filesystem namespace. However, any content written to the file is not guaranteed to be visible, even if the stream is flushed. Once more than a block’s worth of data has been written, the first block will be visible to new readers. This is true of subsequent blocks, too: it is always the current block being written that is not visible to other readers.

- HDFS provides a method for forcing all buffers to be synchronized to the datanodes via the sync() method on FSDataOutputStream. After a successful return from sync(), HDFS guarantees that the data written up to that point in the file has reached all the datanodes in the write pipeline and is visible to all new readers. Closing a file in HDFS performs an implicit sync(), too.

### Data Ingest with Flume and Sqoop

- Apache Flume (http://incubator.apache.org/flume/) is a system for moving large quantities of streaming data into HDFS. Apache Sqoop (http://sqoop.apache.org/), on the other hand, is designed for performing bulk imports of data into HDFS from structured data stores, such as relational databases.

### Parallel Copying with distcp

- Hadoop comes with a useful program called distcp for copying large amounts of data to and from Hadoop filesystems in parallel. distcp is implemented as a MapReduce job where the work of copying is done by the maps that run in parallel across the cluster. There are no reducers. Each file is copied by a single map, and distcp tries to give each map approximately the same amount of data by bucketing files into roughly equal allocations.

### Hadoop Archives

- Hadoop Archives, or HAR files, are a file archiving facility that packs files into HDFS blocks more efficiently, thereby reducing namenode memory usage while still allowing transparent access to files. In particular, Hadoop Archives can be used as input to MapReduce.

- Let’s see what the archive has created:
  ```bash
  % hadoop fs -ls /my
  Found 2 items
  drwxr-xr-x - tom supergroup 0 2009-04-09 19:13 /my/files
  drwxr-xr-x - tom supergroup 0 2009-04-09 19:13 /my/files.har
  % hadoop fs -ls /my/files.har
  Found 3 items
  -rw-r--r-- 10 tom supergroup 165 2009-04-09 19:13 /my/files.har/_index
  -rw-r--r-- 10 tom supergroup 23  2009-04-09 19:13 /my/files.har/_masterindex
  -rw-r--r-- 1  tom supergroup 2   2009-04-09 19:13 /my/files.har/part-0
  ```
	The directory listing shows what a HAR file is made of: two index files and a collection of part files (this example has just one of the latter). The part files contain the contents of a number of the original files concatenated together, and the indexes make it possible to look up the part file that an archived file is contained in, as well as its offset and length. All these details are hidden from the application, however, which uses the har URI scheme to interact with HAR files, using a HAR filesystem that is layered on top of the underlying filesystem (HDFS in this case).
