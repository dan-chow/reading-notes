## Chapter 07: Classes

- The fundamental ideas behind classes are data abstraction and encapsulation.

### 7.1 Defining Abstract Data Types

- We define (ยง 6.1, p. 202) and declare (ยง 6.1.2, p. 206) member functions similarly to ordinary functions. Member functions must be declared inside the class. Member functions may be defined inside the class itself or outside the class body.

- Member functions access the object on which they were called through an extra, implicit parameter named this. When we call a member function, this is initialized with the address of the object on which the function was invoked.

- A const following the parameter list indicates that this is a pointer to const. Member functions that use const in this way are const member functions.

- The fact that this is a pointer to const means that const member functions cannot change the object on which they are called.

- Ordinarily, functions that do output should do minimal formatting.

- Classes control object initialization by defining one or more special member functions known as constructors.

- Classes control default initialization by defining a special constructor, known as the default constructor.

- The compiler-generated constructor is known as the synthesized default constructor.

- Under the new standard, if we want the default behavior, we can ask the compiler to generate the constructor for us by writing = default after the parameter list. 

- A constructor initializer list, which specifies initial values for one or more data members of the object being created.

### 7.2 Access Control and Encapsulation

- In C++ we use access specifiers to enforce encapsulation.

- A class can allow another class or function to access its nonpublic members by making that class or function a friend.

### 7.3 Additional Class Features

- A mutable data member is never const, even when it is a member of a const object. 

- A class can also make another class its friend or it can declare specific member functions of another (previously defined) class as friends.

- It is important to understand that a friend declaration affects access but is not a declaration in an ordinary sense.

### 7.4 Class Scope

- When a member function is defined outside the class body, any name used in the return type is outside the class scope. 

- Member function definitions are processed after the compiler processes all of the declarations in the class.

- Even though the outer object is hidden, it is still possible to access that object by using the scope operator.

- By the time the body of the constructor begins executing, initialization is complete.

- We must use the constructor initializer list to provide values for members that are const, reference, or of a class type that does not have a default constructor.

### 7.5 Constructors Revisited

- Members are initialized in the order in which they appear in the class definition: The first member is initialized first, then the next, and so on. The order in which initializers appear in the constructor initializer list does not change the order of initialization.

- It is a good idea to write constructor initializers in the same order as the members are declared. Moreover, when possible, avoid using members to initialize other members.

- The new standard extends the use of constructor initializers to let us define socalled delegating constructors. A delegating constructor uses another constructor from its own class to perform its initialization.

- Every constructor that can be called with a single argument defines an implicit conversion to a class type. Such constructors are sometimes referred to as converting constructors.

- We can prevent the use of a constructor in a context that requires an implicit conversion by declaring the constructor as explicit:
  ```c++
  class Sales_data {
  public:
    Sales_data() = default;
    Sales_data(const std::string &s, unsigned n, double p):
        bookNo(s), units_sold(n), revenue(p*n) { }
    explicit Sales_data(const std::string &s): bookNo(s) { }
    explicit Sales_data(std::istream&);
    // remaining members as before
  };
  ```

- When a constructor is declared explicit, it can be used only with the direct form of initialization (ยง 3.2.1, p. 84). Moroever, the compiler will not use this constructor in an automatic conversion.

- An aggregate class gives users direct access to its members and has special initialization syntax. A class is an aggregate if
	- All of its data members are public
	- It does not define any constructors
	- It has no in-class initializers
	- It has no base classes or virtual functions

	For example, the following class is an aggregate:
  ```c++
  struct Data {
    int ival;
    string s;
  };
  ```

- A constexpr constructor must initialize every data member. The initializers must either use a constexpr constructor or be a constant expression.

### 7.6 static Class Members

- We say a member is associated with the class by adding the keyword static to its declaration.

- When we define a static member outside the class, we do not repeat the static keyword. The keyword appears only with the declaration inside the class body.

- Even if a const static data member is initialized in the class body, that member ordinarily should be defined outside the class definition.
